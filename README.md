# Lightweight Neural Networks for Kenyan Local Cuisine Recognition on Mobile Devices

This project explores the use of lightweight neural network architectures to recognize Kenyan local cuisines in real-time on mobile devices. The goal is to enable fast and accurate food classification optimized for low-resource environments.

## 📱 Project Summary

This project addresses the challenge of deploying real-time image recognition for Kenyan local cuisines on mobile devices. The core focus is on lightweight neural network architectures optimized for speed and reduced computational footprint, ensuring fast and accurate food classification even in low-resource environments.

The goal is to provide a fast, offline-capable tool to help users identify traditional Kenyan dishes through mobile image recognition.

## Core Technical Goals

## 💻 Model and Data Integration
This repository focuses on the mobile application integration. The following ML components are planned or pending:

### Model Details (To Be Added)
The final model will be deployed in a TFLite format. This section will eventually contain:
- Architecture: [MobileNetV2]
- Input Size: [224x224 pixels]
- Model Size: 
- Target Dishes: [bhajia, chapati, githeri, kachumbari, kukuchoma, mandazi, masalachips, matoke, mukimo, nyamachoma, pilau, sukumawiki, ugali]

Dataset
The model will be trained on a custom dataset of Kenyan cuisines.
